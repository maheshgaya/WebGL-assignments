# WebGL-assignments
DU CS147 - WebGl - Computer Science

These are my code assignments for a WebGL course at Drake University.

##Using Source Code
1. Clone the repository

  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/maheshgaya/WebGL-assignments.git
  ```
2. Each folder has its own Javascript and HTML files. You can open the source code in a text editor.
3. If you want to run the project, open the individual HTML file on a browser. 

  **WARNING: Make sure that [Webgl is enabled](http://superuser.com/questions/836832/how-can-i-enable-webgl-in-my-browser) for your browser!**
